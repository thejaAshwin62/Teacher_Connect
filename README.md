   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure your web service:
     ```
     Name: teacher-connect
     Runtime: Node
     Build Command: npm install && npm run build-client
     Start Command: node index.js
     ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   Add these in Render's environment variables section:

   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=10000
   MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_url
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_LIFETIME=1d
   CLIENT_URL=https://your-app-name.onrender.com
